# HC-SR04 Sensor

## Introduction to the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor for Arduino Uno

The HC-SR04 sensor is an ultrasonic distance sensor commonly used with Arduino Uno boards. It emits ultrasonic sound waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, allowing you to calculate distances. It has a transmitter and a receiver and requires connections to VCC, GND, Trig, and Echo pins on the Arduino Uno.


## Circuit Setup: Using the HC-SR04 Sensor with Arduino Uno to Measure Distance

The circuit setup for using the HC-SR04 sensor with Arduino Uno to measure distance involves connecting the sensor and the Arduino board. The HC-SR04 sensor requires four connections: VCC (power supply), GND (ground), Trig (trigger), and Echo (echo). The VCC pin of the sensor is connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino Uno, the GND pin is connected to the GND pin on the Arduino, the Trig pin is connected to a digital output pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 9), and the Echo pin is connected to a digital input pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 10). This circuit setup allows the Arduino Uno to send trigger signals to the sensor and receive echo signals to calculate distances based on the time it takes for the ultrasonic waves to bounce back. With this setup, the Arduino Uno can accurately measure distances using the HC-SR04 sensor.
